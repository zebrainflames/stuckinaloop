This is a tiny game prototype, built for Ludum Dare 47 in 1.5 days.

Controls:

- **A** and **D**      -- to turn
- **W** or **Space**   -- to thrust
- **M**                -- mute or unmute audio

Playable on itch.io: https://zebrainflames.itch.io/orbital-rescue 

Built with the Godot engine (v. 3.2.1-mono): https://godotengine.org/ 

To build:
- Install Godot (mono version)
- Open the project, build

Only HTML5 exports were tested, there can be issues in other types.

**Known Issues:**

- State handling code is horrid, whole thing could do with a refactoring (there's at least one bug in level resets)
- Audio handling is badly structured
- The project doesn't follow Godot best practices
